Introducing Droid's Create Superflat & Skyblock Crates!

This is a Minecraft mod addon for the Create Mod. This mod allows you to have a sustainable survival world with create - Even in Superflat and Skyblock!

This mod creates a bunch of recipe for all the different crates, simple break the crate to gain a selection of item. Each crates gives some unique item that can help your game progression, and the crafting recipe difficulty increases as you progress. You can view them using JEI. Screenshots of recipes can be seen in the gallery.

This is only for forge 1.20.1, and the Create mod is required. Currently no plans for neoforge 1.20.1, but version for neoforge 1.21 coming soon.

~~**Patchouli Books Strongly Recommended for recipes and loot tables.**~~
